# ðŸ©º Diabetes Classification Using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify whether an individual has diabetes using various machine learning algorithms. Leveraging the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**, the project evaluates different models to find the most accurate and efficient solution for medical diagnosis support.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- **Features**: 8 medical predictor variables (e.g., glucose level, BMI, age)
- **Target**: Binary outcome (1 - diabetic, 0 - non-diabetic)

## ðŸ§  Models Used
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## ðŸ§ª Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

## âœ… Results
Among the tested models, the **Random Forest classifier** achieved the highest accuracy and balanced performance across all metrics, making it the most effective model for this classification task.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
Machine learning techniques, particularly ensemble models like Random Forest, can significantly aid in early detection of diabetes. This project highlights how data-driven approaches can enhance medical diagnostics.
